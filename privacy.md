We do not store or share your precise location information with third parties.

## Use of Information

The information collected by ShopLens is used for the following purposes:

- To provide and improve the shopping experience within the App.
- To identify products based on barcode scanning or image recognition.
- To recommend nearby shopping locations based on your device's location.
